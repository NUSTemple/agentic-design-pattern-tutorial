# Agentic Design Pattern Practice

This repository contains code examples and exercises for practicing concepts from the book **Agentic Design Pattern** by Google. The goal of this repo is to help you learn and experiment with agent-based architectures, tools, and coordination strategies as described in the book.

## Structure

- `src/` — Source code for each chapter and example
- `pyproject.toml` — Project configuration
- `.env` — (Optional) Environment variables for local development

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-design-pattern.git
   cd agentic-design-pattern
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or use poetry/pipenv if preferred
   ```
4. Set up your `.env` file if needed (see `.env.example` if available).

## Usage

- Explore the `src/` directory for code samples and agent implementations.
- Run examples directly or use the Google ADK CLI for agent orchestration.

## Notes

- This repository is for educational and practice purposes only.
- You will need access to Google ADK and authentication for some examples.
